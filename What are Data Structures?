What are Data Structures?
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. They provide a means to manage large amounts of data for various applications, such as databases, operating systems, and network services. Common data structures include:

Arrays: A collection of elements identified by index or key.
Linked Lists: A sequence of elements, each pointing to the next, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion.
Stacks: A collection of elements that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
Queues: A collection of elements that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
Trees: A hierarchical structure with nodes representing data points, commonly used for searching and sorting.
Graphs: A collection of nodes connected by edges, used to represent networks.
